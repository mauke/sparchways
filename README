This is a very basic terminfo format string interpreter library. It doesn't
depend on curses or any other library. It also doesn't use global variables, so
it should be thread-safe.

Basic documentation is in the doc/ directory.

To use it, compile sparchways.c into a library.
Include "sparchways.h" in your code.
